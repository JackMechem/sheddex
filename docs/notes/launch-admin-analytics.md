### Launch prep: feedback, reports, an admin panel, link previews (2026-10-17, web)

Before sharing sheddex with friends and family (a few hundred people).

**Feedback.** A **Report a bug** pill sits in the bottom-right corner of every page
(`components/feedback/FeedbackFab.tsx`, mounted in `AppChrome`, z-45, above the safe area); its
little × hides it on that device (localStorage `jam-practice-feedback-fab-hidden`; rendered hidden on
the server so it never flashes; `showFeedbackFab()` brings it back). `ToolLayout`'s bottom-right
credit line moved up to clear it. People can also send feedback from: the sidebar's ⋮ menu ("Send feedback"; on
phones it's an icon in the menu header), `/feedback`, and the footers of the landing page and
dashboard.
- **The form** (`components/feedback/FeedbackForm.tsx`) offers three kinds: Something's broken,
  An idea, Something else.
- **What's attached:** the page and the browser's user agent always go with the message. Signed in,
  you can add a screenshot (≤10 MB); signed out, there's an optional reply-to email.
- **Reports:** post pages and other people's profiles have a **Report** button, which opens the
  same form in report mode with the post or profile attached.
- **The dialog** is `FeedbackDialog`, mounted once in `AppChrome`. Open it from anywhere with
  `openFeedback({kind?, target?})` (a `sheddex:open-feedback` window event).
- **On `/feedback`,** signed-in people see what they've sent and its status.
- **Backend:** `packages/convex/feedback.ts` (`submit`, which allows 10 an hour per account;
  `generateUploadUrl`; `mine`) and a `feedback` table (kind, message, page, userAgent, screenshotId,
  target, status new|seen|planned|done|closed, adminNote).
- **Account deletion** removes the account's feedback and its screenshots.

**Admin panel** (`/admin`, `components/admin/AdminPage.tsx`, `packages/convex/admin.ts`).
- **Who gets in:**
  - The **owner**: `OWNER_EMAIL` (hardcoded in `admin.ts`, "mechemjack@gmail.com") **and** that
    email verified (`users.emailVerificationTime`, which Convex Auth only sets after an emailed code
    or Google proves the address). No env var or setting changes this. Nothing in the app writes
    `users.email`.
  - **Admins**: accounts the owner adds (table `admins`, `{userId, grantedBy, grantedAt}`;
    `grantAdmin` / `revokeAdmin`, owner only; Users tab → Make admin / Remove admin, with a
    type-the-username confirm). Admins can do everything else in the panel, except act on another
    admin's or the owner's account or posts (`cannotModerate`). Nobody can act on the owner, or on
    themselves, from the panel. Account deletion removes the `admins` row.
  - `myRole` returns "owner" | "admin" | null; `users` returns each account's `role`.
  - Every query and mutation checks this on the server, so the hidden link isn't the only lock.
  - Verified on dev with @jack2 made admin then removed: it couldn't grant itself, revoke, or
    delete or hide the owner; the owner couldn't delete themselves.
- **Non-admins** see "Nothing here". The page has noindex set. The admin gets an "Admin" button
  above the account row in the sidebar (desktop, collapsed and phone menu; `AdminButton` in
  `Sidebar.tsx`) and an "Admin" item in the ⋮ menus (`lib/useIsAdmin.ts`); neither renders for
  anyone else.
- **Tabs** (kept in `?tab=`):
  - **Overview:** accounts, posts, inbox and open reports cards; 30-day sign-ups chart; public
    profiles, teachers and students; latest inbox items; newest accounts.
  - **Inbox:** filter by status and kind, search; set the status; a private note (saved on blur);
    Reply (mailto with the message quoted); the screenshot (click to enlarge); device; delete.
    Reports show the target with Open and Remove post.
  - **Posts:** every Community post with its author, likes and report count; "Reported only"; open
    it; remove it (`removePost` deletes its likes and marks reports about it done).
  - **Users:** every account with email, username, public/private, sign-in methods, post count and
    join date. **Make private** (`setProfilePublic`). **Delete** asks you to type their username,
    then `deleteUser` (an action) runs the same full cascade as deleting your own account
    (`account.performDelete`). You can't delete yourself or another admin.
- Lists cap at 500 feedback items, 500 posts and 2,000 accounts. They need paging past that.

**Link previews:**
- `app/layout.tsx` metadata now has `metadataBase` (from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, else
  https://sheddex.com), a title template ("%s · sheddex"; the pages' own " · sheddex" suffixes were
  removed), a real description, and openGraph/twitter (`summary_large_image`).
- `app/opengraph-image.tsx` draws the card: the logo from `Logo.tsx`'s exported paths, a tagline
  and tool chips, at 1200×630.

**Legal and docs:**
- Terms: rewrote "Your content", which said recordings never leave the browser (no longer true).
  Added "Community and moderation" (rules, reports, removal at discretion).
- Privacy: added "Feedback and reports" and "Administration" (the admin can see account
  emails/usernames and remove posts and accounts, and doesn't browse private data).
- Both contact sections point at `/feedback`. README rewritten.

**Checked:** the git history has no committed `.env` files or API keys (`.env*` is gitignored).

**Verified:**
- Convex dev push; `amIAdmin` is true for Jack, and @jack2 is refused.
- `tsc`, `eslint`, `pnpm build`.
- In nix Chromium, signed in as Jack: sent a feedback, saw it in the overview and inbox; the Posts
  and Users tabs with real data; 390 px with no overflow; no console errors. The test feedback was
  deleted afterwards.
- The OG image renders.

**Not verified:** removing a real post and deleting a real account from the panel (not done on
purpose), the screenshot upload, the Report flow end to end, and the 10-an-hour limit.

#### Launch checklist (only Jack can do these)

1. **Deploy prod.** The newest backend (lessons, booking, feedback, admin, …) is on the **dev**
   Convex deployment only. A Vercel production build runs `convex deploy` and pushes it to prod.
   Watch that build's log, then check `/admin` on sheddex.com.
2. **Fix the email sender.** Prod `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM` is still `jackshed <noreply@jackshed.com>`, so
   every sign-up code and password-reset email says "jackshed".
   - Verify sheddex.com in Resend (its DNS records).
   - Then run `npx convex env set AUTH_EMAIL_FROM 'sheddex <noreply@sheddex.com>' --prod`, and the
     same without `--prod` for dev.
   - Send yourself a sign-up code to check it.
3. **Google sign-in on prod.** In Google Cloud Console, publish the OAuth consent screen ("In
   production"). While it's in "Testing", only listed test users can sign in with Google.
4. **Limits:**
   - Resend's free plan sends 100 emails a day (3,000 a month), and a sign-up wave can hit that.
   - Check Convex's free-tier bandwidth and storage in the dashboard after the first few days.
     Recordings and sample files are the big items.
5. **Test the real thing on prod** with a fresh email: sign up, sign in on another device, send
   feedback, report a post, and see it in `/admin`.
6. **Backups:** turn on Convex's periodic backups for prod (Dashboard → Backups) before the user
   count grows.

### Mayday switches (2026-10-17, web; backend dev deployed)

Admin → **Mayday** (`components/admin/Mayday.tsx`). The flags live in one `siteFlags` row (key
"site"; `packages/convex/lib/site.ts`: `SiteFlags`, `siteFlags`, `communityHidden`,
`assertUploadsOpen`). Only the **owner** can flip them (`admin.setSiteFlags`, `resetSiteFlags`); other
admins see them read-only. Roles moved to `packages/convex/lib/roles.ts` (`OWNER_EMAIL`, `roleOf`,
`staffMe`, `isStaff`), and `admin.ts` uses them.
- **Maintenance mode**: everyone who isn't staff sees `MaintenanceScreen` (logo, "Back soon", your
  message). `AppChrome` renders only that screen (`useMaintenance`), so nothing of the app mounts,
  split screen included. `/reset-password` stays reachable. The screen has an **Admin sign in**
  button (the app's `SignInModal`); signed in as a non-admin, it says so and offers Sign out.
  This is client-side only (the tools run in the browser anyway); the backend keeps working.
- **Community off**: on the server, every `communityTunes` read returns empty/null, likes and posting
  refuse, and `profiles.getPublicByUsername` / `search` and the shared setlist / routine links
  return nothing. Staff are exempt, so they can moderate. `SiteGate` (in `AppChrome`) shows "Community
  is taking a break" on `/community*`, `/post`, `/u`, `/setlist`, `/routine`, and on
  `/setlist-charts?post|shared`.
- **Pause posting** (`communityTunes.create` refuses; New post shows a notice).
- **Pause sign-ups**: Convex Auth's `callbacks.afterUserCreatedOrUpdated` in `auth.ts` throws for a
  brand-new user. It runs in the user-creating transaction, so no account is made. Covers email and
  Google. The sign-up form shows a notice.
- **Pause uploads**: `assertUploadsOpen` is in all five `generate*UploadUrl` mutations (profiles,
  recordings — also used for tune songs —, feedback, lessons files, hand-ins).
- **Pause feedback**: `feedback.submit` refuses; the form shows a notice and the bug button hides.
- **Announcement banner** (text, info / warning): `SiteBanner` floats at the top of every page.
  Closing it hides that exact text on the device (localStorage `jam-practice-banner-dismissed`).
  Staff also see a red "Mayday on: …" pill linking to the tab.
- **Sign everyone out** (an action): deletes every `authSessions` row and its refresh tokens, 100
  at a time, except the owner's own.
- **Automatic limits, always on**: 10 Community posts a day per account (staff exempt;
  `MAX_POSTS_PER_DAY`), and 30 signed-out feedback messages an hour site-wide
  (`MAX_ANON_PER_HOUR`).
- `site.status` (open to anyone) gives the web app the flags plus `staff` (`lib/useSiteStatus.ts`).

Verified on dev:
- Only the owner can flip (@jack2 was refused). With the flags on, a signed-out caller and @jack2
  got an empty feed while the owner still saw it; uploads and feedback were refused.
- In nix Chromium, signed out: the maintenance screen showed; Admin sign in → Jack → the site came
  back with the Mayday pill. The Community-off page and the banner showed, and the tools still
  worked. `resetSiteFlags` put everything back.
- `tsc` and `eslint` (web, convex).

Not exercised: pause sign-ups with a real new account, and Sign everyone out (only reasoned
through, not run on dev).

### Analytics and anonymous usage counts (2026-10-17, web; backend dev deployed)

**Usage counts** (new): `packages/convex/usage.ts` `track` mutation.
- **What's stored:** one `usageDaily` row per UTC day × kind × key, holding only `n` and `ms`.
  Kinds: `visit` (key "account" / "guest"), `view` (page path), `play` (tool started), `time` (tool
  running ms). No user id, device id or IP.
- **What's refused:** bad kinds or keys (a path regex), anything past 40 events a call, and anything
  from staff (checked on the server).
- **Sending** (`apps/web/lib/usage.ts`):
  - queues events and sends them in batches through `components/UsageTracker.tsx`, mounted in
    `AppChrome`: ~5 s after something is queued, every 30 s, and when the tab hides;
  - one visit per browser per local day (localStorage `jam-practice-visit-day`);
  - page views per route, with ids taken out (`normalizePath`: `/post/[id]`, `/u/[username]`…);
  - tool starts and run time come from `lib/toolTime.ts`'s `useToolActivity`, the same "the tool is
    actually running" signal the Shed Log uses.
- **Skipped:** blocked until auth and site status are known, and skipped for staff and for browsers
  with Do Not Track or Global Privacy Control.
- The privacy policy was rewritten shorter, with a "Usage counts" section. It used to say "no
  analytics", and that recordings stay in the browser; neither was true any more.

**Admin → Analytics** (`components/admin/Analytics.tsx`) reads from
`packages/convex/adminAnalytics.ts` `analytics({days})`.
- **How it reads:** an action, staff only, that pages through each table with the internal `scan`
  query (1,000 rows a page; usage 2,000), and through the Shed Log blobs with `scanPractice` (40 a
  page, minutes per log day via `minutesOn`, plus tool minutes from `sessions[].tool`).
- **What it returns:** per-day series and breakdowns:
  - accounts: signups, sign-ins, active accounts (distinct users with a session or refresh token
    that day);
  - Community: posts, likes, follows, shared setlists;
  - content: recordings and their minutes, charts added;
  - Lessons: students, items, bookings;
  - feedback;
  - usage: visits (signed in or not), page views, tool starts and minutes;
  - practice: minutes and people practising;
  - breakdowns: tools, pages, sign-in methods, instruments, post kinds, feedback kinds.
- **On the page:**
  - The range is 7 / 30 / 90 / 180 / 365 days; it fetches twice the range for the "vs before"
    comparisons.
  - KPI cards with sparklines and the change against the previous period.
  - Customizable chart cards: any of 22 metrics; line, area, bars or stacked bars; daily, weekly or
    monthly; running total; full width; title; reorder; remove; add. Saved per device in
    `jam-practice-admin-charts`, with "Reset charts to the defaults". Legend chips hide a series,
    and hovering shows a tooltip.
  - Breakdown cards as bars or a donut (tools by starts, minutes or Shed Log minutes).
  - All charts are plain SVG, no chart library; the y-axis steps are 1 / 2 / 2.5 / 5 × 10ⁿ
    (`niceStep`).
- Days are UTC, except practice, which uses each person's log days.

Verified:
- `track` rejected a junk key and ignored an owner call; signed out, `analytics` was refused.
- In nix Chromium, a signed-out visit counted its visit, page views, a Metronome start and run time
  (after the 5 s send was added — before it, a short visit lost its tool start).
- The tab rendered with real dev data; customizing (stacked, weekly, added a metric) saved to
  storage; the tooltip and axis ticks were right; no horizontal overflow at 390 px.
- `next build`.
- The test usage rows were cleared (`convex import --replace` with an empty file).

### Landing page: new screenshots and a teaching section (2026-10-18, web)

- **Screenshots:** `public/landing/v3/` (`SHOTS = "v3"` in `Landing.tsx`; `v2` deleted). Shots: `app`
  (dashboard, 1440×900), `setlist` (1024×640), `phone` (390×700), `split` (Metronome + Tuner,
  1050×550), and the new `lessons` and `lesson` (1280×800). All are light + dark at 2× (a
  `deviceScaleFactor: 2` context, signed in to Jack's **dev** account inside the script).
- **What was masked before each shot:** the account email, the scrollbars, the sidebar chevron, the
  bug button and the intros. A few test names were swapped in the page text: "Another test
  Setlist" → "Friday night gig", "@jack2" → "@maya.plays", "Test Student" → "Sam Rivera".
- **The lesson shots** used a temporary demo pair: Jack teaching "Maya Chen" (@jack2 joined), four
  dated lessons, notes, two charts and two assignments. It was deleted afterwards with
  `lessons.removeStudent`.
- **Teaching section:** `TeachingSection` (nav link "Teaching", `#teaching`): a heading and intro,
  the student-page shot with the lesson-page shot overlapping it, then four points across.
- **Retaking:** use a new folder (`v4`) and bump `SHOTS`.

**Sidebar (same day):**
- Admin is in the ⋮ menus again (desktop, collapsed, phone; admins only), and the always-visible
  Admin button was removed.
- The account row lost its ⋮ (Sign out is on the Account page).
- The sidebar's Recent row was removed; Community / Tunes / Lessons are bolder cards with a "Tools"
  heading under them.
- A faint chevron at the page's top-left (`SidebarToggle`) hides and shows the sidebar.
- The resize handle is a 16px grab strip with a faint pill; double-click resets the width.
- Width: min 220, default 244.
