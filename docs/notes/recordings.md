### Mobile: a new, simple Recorder linked to tunes, with recordings on the backend (2026-10-08)

Jack wants the Recorder reworked everywhere — no multitrack, just one take at a time with an
optional metronome, recordings saved to the account and linkable to tunes. **Mobile first; the web
Recorder is still the old multitrack one** (and the shared `navLinks` description still says so).

- **Backend** (`packages/convex/recordings.ts`, schema `recordings` — **dev deployment only** until
  Jack pushes): one row per recording (name, notes, durationSec, mimeType, optional `tuneId`) with
  the audio in Convex file storage. `generateUploadUrl` → POST file → `create`; `list`,
  `listForTune`, `get` (each with the file `url`), `update` (rename / notes / `tuneId`, `null`
  unlinks), `remove` (deletes the file too). `tuneId` is a plain string (tunes live inside the
  synced tunes blob), so a recording whose tune was deleted just shows as unlinked. Account
  deletion now also deletes recordings and their files.
- **Recording** (`apps/mobile/src/lib/recorderEngine.ts`): `react-native-audio-api`'s
  `AudioRecorder` with file output — M4A/AAC, mono, 44.1kHz, 128kbps (~1MB/min) — plus an RMS level
  meter from `onAudioReady`. The optional metronome is the shared `metronomeEngine`; with a count-in
  the take starts on the downbeat after it. Its click goes through the speaker, so the mic records
  it unless you wear headphones.
- **Screens**: `tool/recorder` (big record button, timer, level, metronome on/off + tempo; count-in,
  beats per bar, sound in Options; signed out → sign-in prompt; `?tuneId=` records for that tune with
  the metronome at the tune's tempo), `recordings/save` (listen back, name — "Take N" for a tune,
  else date/time — tune link, notes; Discard asks first, back is blocked), `recordings/[id]` (play,
  rename, notes, link/change/unlink tune, delete), `recordings/index` (My recordings: search, inline
  play). A tune's page (`library/tune.tsx`) has a **Recordings** section: its takes (inline play),
  "Record a take" and "Link existing". Playback is `expo-audio` streaming the Convex URL, one
  player per screen (`useRecordingPlayer`). Settings key `jam-practice-recorder-take`.

Verified: `tsc`/`eslint`, the Convex push (only added the table + 2 indexes), signed-out calls
behave (`list` → `[]`, upload refused), release build installed. **Recording, upload and playback
not yet tried on the device.**

Follow-up: the Recorder's metronome is now the full Metronome tool — same settings shape (stored
under `jam-practice-recorder-take`, separate from the Metronome tool's own), same on-page controls
(tempo + tap, time signature, the tappable beat strip with sub-accents, lit while clicking) and the
same options (tempo note value, accent grouping, subdivision, structures, sound) behind an Options
button inside the metronome section, plus a Count-in tab. Changes mid-take apply live
(`updateRecorderMetronome`); the count-in length follows the first section of a structure and the
tempo note value.

Follow-ups from the first real device test: (1) uploads failed with a 400 — `fetch(file://…).blob()`
handed Convex an empty body on Android; `uploadRecordingFile` now streams the file natively
(`expo-file-system/legacy`'s `uploadAsync`, binary body) and surfaces Convex's error text. (2) Takes
were very quiet: `react-native-audio-api`'s recorder is patched to always open the mic
`Unprocessed` (for the tuner). Takes now record through `expo-audio`'s recorder instead (created
directly via `AudioModule.AudioRecorder`, metering polled for the level meter) with an **Auto gain**
toggle (default on) choosing Android's `camcorder` source (system AGC) vs `unprocessed`. The tuner's
own input is unchanged. (3) The recording page shows a header Save button while name/notes have
unsaved edits, and saves them on leaving too.

**Recordings in shared setlists:** `convex/lib/setlists.ts`'s `liveSetlist(…, "full")` — what a
setlist share link (`setlists.getShared`) and a Community setlist post (`communityTunes.get`) read —
now attaches each tune's recordings (`PublicTune.recordings: PublicRecording[]`: id, name, duration,
date, file URL; **never notes**), so anyone the setlist is shared with can play them. Only the live
setlist carries them (a deleted setlist's stored snapshot has none). Mobile `PublicSetlist`: a mic
button with the count on a tune row expands its recordings inline (play only); web `PublicSetlist`
lists them with native `<audio controls>`. "Save as my setlist" doesn't copy recordings
(`toOwnTune` copies explicit fields only). Verified: deployed to dev, a share link fetched signed out
still works; not yet seen with a tune that actually has recordings.

### Web: the new Recorder + recordings, replacing the multitrack Recorder (2026-10-08)

The web app now matches the mobile Recorder; the old multitrack recorder is gone (`Recorder.tsx`
rewritten; `lib/{clips,splice,multitrack,projectStore,syncBurst,alignBeat,wav}.ts` deleted — only
it used them; Slow Downer's `Waveform`/`audioFile`/`fileLibrary`/`markers` stay). Old multitrack
projects lived only in each browser's IndexedDB and are no longer reachable. `navLinks`: Recorder
is no longer `desktopOnly` and has a new description.

- `lib/recorderEngine.ts` (web): `MediaRecorder` on `getUserMedia({ autoGainControl, echoCancellation:
  false, noiseSuppression: false })` — **Auto gain** maps to the browser's `autoGainControl`. Picks
  `audio/mp4` (AAC where the browser has it) before WebM/Opus. Level meter via an `AnalyserNode`.
  Metronome = the Metronome tool's own `lib/metronomeEngine.ts`, count-in like mobile.
- `components/Recorder.tsx`: `ToolLayout` with the metronome's options in the options column
  (Meter & subdivision incl. structures, Count-in, Metronome sound), main area: timer, level,
  record button, Auto gain, a Metronome section (`TempoHero` + tempo-note picker + `BeatIndicator`),
  recent recordings. Same settings key as mobile (`jam-practice-recorder-take`). `/recorder?tuneId=`
  records for a tune. Stopping opens `SaveTakeDialog` (preview, name, tune, notes).
- `/recordings` (`components/recordings/RecordingsPage.tsx`) and `/recordings/view?id=`
  (`RecordingPage.tsx`: play, rename, notes with Save button + save-on-leave, link/unlink tune,
  delete). `TuneHub` has a Recordings section (`TuneRecordings`). Playback is native `<audio>`.
- Gotcha hit and fixed: revoking the take's object URL in an effect cleanup broke the preview in
  dev (React's double-mount) — it's revoked on Save/Discard instead.

Verified: `tsc`, `eslint`, `next build`; in nix Chromium with a fake microphone: metronome on →
count-in → recording → Stop → save dialog with a playable 1.7s take, no console errors (signed-out
gate temporarily bypassed for the check, then restored). Upload/list/playback of saved takes on web
not exercised (needs a signed-in session).

### Web: a tune's song behind its recordings, with a mixer (2026-10-13)

A tune page's Recordings section has a **Song** row: upload an audio file of the actual tune
(mp3/m4a/wav/…, ≤100 MB), replace or remove it. Backend (**dev deployed only**):
`packages/convex/tuneSongs.ts` (`getForTune`, `set` — replaces and deletes the old file —,
`remove`; table `tuneSongs`, one per `(userId, tuneId)`, file in Convex storage, uploaded through
`recordings.generateUploadUrl`), and `recordings.mix` (optional `{songVolume, takeVolume,
offsetSec}`, accepted by `create`/`update`, returned by every recordings query). Account deletion
deletes songs and their files.
- `components/recordings/MixPlayer.tsx` is a small DAW-style track view (after the old multitrack
  Recorder): Song and Take tracks, each with a header (mute, solo, level meter, volume fader) and
  its region drawn as a waveform on one canvas with a ruler (0:00 = the take's start) and a
  playhead. Click/drag the ruler or lanes to seek/scrub, drag the Song region sideways to line it
  up (or nudge ±1 s/0.1/0.01), Ctrl/⌘+wheel or −/+/Fit to zoom, sideways wheel to pan, Space to
  play. `lib/recordingPlayback.ts` downloads and decodes both files (`fetch` — Convex storage
  sends CORS headers for the site's origin; LRU cache of 4) and plays them as `AudioBuffer`s on
  one clock (`TimelinePlayer`), one timeline at a time site-wide. The first version streamed two
  `<audio>` elements, and seeking jumped back — browser-recorded files often aren't seekable when
  streamed. `compact lazy` (the tune page's cards) downloads nothing until Play. `SavedMixPlayer`
  saves mix changes to the recording (600 ms debounce, and on unmount); the save dialog uses it too.
  **Editor** (the transport's maximize button) turns the same view full screen (`fixed inset-0`,
  lanes share the height, Esc closes, page scroll locked) without reloading anything. **Snap** (on by
  default): a dragged Song region's start or end snaps, within 10 px, to the take's start/end, the
  playhead, or a ruler line (major and half-step lines, both drawn full height); clip edges and the
  playhead win over ruler lines; Alt drags freely; an accent line shows the snap. Verified in nix
  Chromium: a drag ending near the take's start landed exactly on 0, Alt left −0.37, one ending
  4 px from the 1 s line landed on it, one 12 px away didn't snap; Esc closed the editor.
  **Phones:** the track headers shrink to 4.5rem (name, M/S, meter) and the faders move to a row
  under the tracks; full-screen lanes are capped (190 px on phones, 340 px otherwise). Touch: a tap
  moves the playhead, a horizontal drag scrubs or moves the Song region (it waits 6 px to tell a
  drag from a page scroll — outside full screen the lanes are `touch-pan-y`, and a cancelled
  gesture undoes the drag), two fingers pinch-zoom and scroll. Checked at 390 px with emulated
  touch (tap, pinch, a snapped drag, full screen).
- **Recorder** (`?tuneId=` with a song): "Play the song" (setting `playSong`), start point (±5 s),
  song volume (`songVolume`, live). `lib/recorderEngine.ts` preloads the song during the count-in,
  starts it with the take, and the finished take carries `songOffsetSec` = start point − the time
  the song took to start − output/input latency; the save dialog previews the take over the song
  and saves that mix. The mic records the song too unless you wear headphones.
- Track view verified in nix Chromium (temporary page, generated audio): seeking paused and while
  playing sticks, dragging the Song region changes the line-up, zoom, the lazy card; no errors.
- The first player was verified the same way: song position stayed within ~50 ms of take + offset through play, nudges, a negative offset (song comes in
  late), pause, seek and the end; volumes applied; and a fake-mic take with the song started at
  5 s came back with a 4.979 s line-up. `tsc` (web, mobile, convex), `eslint`, `next build`.
  **Not verified:** anything signed in (uploading a real song, the tune page/recording page/Recorder
  UI with real data), and how well the automatic line-up matches by ear. **Mobile not done yet** —
  it ignores `mix` and has no song upload.

**Mono recording (web Recorder, same day):** a **Mono** switch under Auto gain (settings `mono`,
`monoSource`: Left / Mix / Right) for interfaces that put a single mic on one side only.
`lib/recorderEngine.ts` routes the mic through Web Audio into a one-channel
`MediaStreamDestination` (a channel splitter for Left/Right, a 1-channel downmix for Mix = the
average, so a one-sided mic comes out half as loud) and records that. Verified in nix Chromium
with a fake right-only stereo input: off → 2 channels (0 / 0.707 RMS), Right → 1 channel 0.708,
Mix → 0.354, Left → silence. Takes already recorded one-sided aren't changed.


**Takes without a song scrub now (2026-10-20):** a take recorded in the browser is WebM with no
duration or seek index, so the browser's `<audio>` couldn't scrub it (reported on Mac Firefox: the
playhead stuck at the end). Takes without a song now play in `components/recordings/TakePlayer.tsx`:
Play/Pause, a `.slider` scrubber and the times, decoding the file on the first Play with
`loadAudio` and playing it on a one-track `TimelinePlayer` (stored `durationSec` shows the length
before then). Used on the recording page, the recording cards and the save dialog. Checked in
headless Chromium with a MediaRecorder WebM made on the page: play, scrub, stop at the end. Not
checked in Firefox itself.
