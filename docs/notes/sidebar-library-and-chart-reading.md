### The sidebar's tools, reorganized (2026-10-17, web; the categories are shared with mobile)

`packages/core/navLinks.ts`: categories are now by what you're doing — **Play along** (Jam
Practice, Bass Genius, Slow Downer, Drum Generator), **Time & rhythm** (Metronome, the Polyrhythm
metronome, Tempo Trainer), **Ear training** (the three Guess tools), **On your instrument** (Note,
Scale, Interval Trainer, Tuner), **Drums** (Sticking Warmup, Syncopation), **Practice tools** (Shed
Log, Practice Timer, Recorder) — plus Community as before. A new optional `short` name is used only
in the sidebar list ("Metric Modulation", "Sticking Warmup", "Intervals" / "Chords" /
"Progressions"); search, titles, Help and everything else use `label`. `components/tools.tsx`:
`CATEGORY_ICONS` updated, new `CATEGORY_COLORS` (one fixed hue per category). Sidebar
(`components/Sidebar.tsx`): no more boxed sections — each category is a small heading you click
to fold (shows its count while folded), tools are compact rows with a `ToolTile` (the icon on a tint
of its category's color, solid on the current page); a **Recent** row (the last 3 tools opened on
this device, not the current one, shown once there are 2+); Favorites as a section with a star;
the "Tools" heading is gone. Collapsed sidebar: the icon buttons carry the category colors too.
The Help page's groups follow the new categories. The mobile app groups by the same categories
(names changed there too; it doesn't use `short` yet). Checked in nix Chromium (expanded,
collapsed, phone menu); `tsc` (web, mobile), `eslint`, `next build`.

**Category colors follow the theme:** the fixed hues clashed with some themes, so
`CATEGORY_COLORS` now points at CSS vars `--cat-0…6` (`app/globals.css`), each the theme's own
`--accent` with its hue turned by a fixed step (`oklch(from var(--accent) l max(c, 0.09) calc(h + N))`
— 0/154/308/103/257/51/206°, a chroma floor so grey-ish accents still give distinct colors). So
they take the accent's lightness and saturation: soft on Zenburn/Rosé Pine Dawn, bright on
Synthwave, and rotate along with any custom accent. Browsers without relative color syntax get the
old fixed hexes. A solid (current page) tile's icon uses `--accent-foreground`. Checked across 12
presets in nix Chromium.

**Favorites as cards:** the sidebar's Favorites section is a two-column grid of small cards
(`renderFavoriteCard` in `Sidebar.tsx`, via `CategoryBlock`'s new `renderCard`): the tool's tile
and short name on a tint of its category color (no border; a stronger tint on the current page), a
filled star in the corner to unstar it. While searching it falls back to plain rows. Checked in
nix Chromium with favorites patched in temporarily (then removed).

### Tunes and Chord Charts redesigned (2026-10-17, web)

Every Tunes / Chord Charts page now uses `components/library/ui.tsx` (`shared.tsx` is unchanged,
since Community, recordings and the Shed Log also use it):
- **`Hero`**: the header card on every page. It has a tint of the page's colour, an icon tile or a
  key badge, the title (two lines max) and a summary line, the page's buttons (they wrap under the
  title on phones), and its search (`HeroSearch`). The three main pages also show **`LibraryTabs`**
  (Tunes · Setlists · Chord Charts); sub-pages show a back link instead.
- **`KeyBadge`**: the tune's or chart's key in a tile of that key's colour. The colours come from
  `--key-0…11` in globals.css, one per key, taken from the theme accent the same way as the
  category colours. Keys a fifth apart get neighbouring hues.
- **Rows and cards:** `TuneItem` / `ChartItem` rows (badge, name, small chips) sit inside `Panel`
  cards with hairline dividers. Lists on the dashboards are `ShelfCard`s (count plus the latest
  names). Playlists are `PlaylistCard`s, with a cover in the playlist's colour (`nameColor`) showing
  its first charts. Setlists are `SetlistCard`s (tune count in the setlist's colour, its description
  or first tunes). The dashboards' "Recently opened" is now `RecentStrip` ("Jump back in").
- **Pages:**
  - Tunes dashboard: lists as shelf cards, then Tunes I Know (latest additions) and Tunes to
    Learn, with Setlists beside them.
  - Chord Charts dashboard: Import and New in the header, playlists as a card grid, "New playlist".
  - Playlist page: letter sections with sticky headers, plus an A–Z jump bar when there are more
    than 6 letters.
  - Setlists page: a card grid, with Recent / A–Z in the header.
  - Setlist page: numbered rows with the key each tune is played in; View all charts / Share /
    Post sit in a side column.
  - Tune page: the chart on the left, with keys (a progress bar, and known keys in their own
    colour) and notes on the right from `xl`; recordings under the chart.
  - Chart view: the header became a `Hero` (composer, style, time, playlists as chips). The chart
    and its container are unchanged.
  - Tune list (`TuneListManager variant="page"`): the Account tabs keep the old card look.
  - Import: numbered steps, plus side cards for what happens and "Start over".
- The chart renderer, the chart editor and the setlist chart reader are untouched. The old
  `SetlistRow` is gone.

Verified: `tsc`, `eslint`, `next build`. In nix Chromium (signed out, seeded with tunes, 50 charts
from Jack's playlist, 3 playlists and 2 setlists), every page at 1440 and 390 wide, plus Gruvbox
Dark. Also checked the Add menu, selecting a tune, a drag reorder of a setlist and chart search; no
errors.

### Sidebar: Community and Tunes as cards, no Chord Charts button (2026-10-17, web)

The row of three library tiles (Community / Tunes / Chord Charts) is now two cards side by side
under the Dashboard and Shed Log cards: Community and Tunes. Each card is a `@container`: the icon
sits above a smaller label while the card is under 7.5rem wide (the default sidebar width), and
beside it when the sidebar is wider or on phones. Each card has the category-coloured
icon tile (solid while you're there) and the name. They are slimmer than those two cards and have
no second line. Chord Charts has no button of its own: the Tunes card stays lit on `/chord-charts*`
and `/setlist-charts` (`isChartsPath` in `Sidebar.tsx`), and the collapsed sidebar's library group
does the same. Chord Charts still shows up as a search result. Checked in nix Chromium.

### Help screenshots retaken signed in (2026-10-17)

`public/help/v3/` (`SHOTS = "v3"` in `components/help/helpParts.tsx`; `v2` was deleted) holds all
the Help pictures, taken signed in to Jack's account on the **dev** deployment, so they show his real
tunes, charts, Shed Log, recordings and profile. The account's email is replaced with
"you@example.com" in the page before each shot, because the Help page is public. New shots:
`account`, `recordings` and `recorder` (their topics in `lib/helpContent.ts` gained `shot`).
How they were taken:
- the nix chromium + playwright-core setup;
- signing in through `/?auth=login` *inside the same script*, because the session didn't survive
  between separate CDP connections;
- intros and the Shed Log tour marked as seen;
- light then dark;
- 1280×800 of the content area.
Retake them into a new folder (`v4`) when the UI changes. Never write the account password into a
file: pass it in an environment variable.

### Full-width pages on desktop (2026-10-17, web)

From `lg` these pages are full width (`lg:max-w-none lg:px-8`; phones keep their max width):
- the dashboard (`Home.tsx`);
- every Tunes / Chord Charts page (`LibraryPage`, which lost its `wide` prop);
- `shared.tsx`'s `PageShell`: recordings, routines, chart view and editor, import (Community and New post opt out with `fullWidth={false}` and keep `max-w-5xl`/`max-w-4xl`, on request);
- Account (signed in);
- post pages and public profiles.

Reading pages (legal, shared setlist / routine links) stay narrow. The playlist and setlist card
grids add columns on wide screens (5–6 playlists, 3–4 setlists a row). The chart renderer keeps its
own maximum size. Checked in nix Chromium at 2000 wide, signed in: no horizontal overflow.

### Chart reading redesigned (2026-10-17, web)

New shared pieces live in `components/library/chartView.tsx`:
- `ChartPaper`: the card a chart sits on, with an optional top row. `fill` makes it fill the height.
- `ChartMeta`: chips for style, key ("Fm · from Dm" when transposed), time and tempo, plus the
  composer unless `composer={false}`.
- `ReaderBar`: the top bar for full-screen reading (round back/close button, key badge, title,
  controls).
- `RoundButton`.

The chart itself (`ChordChart`) is untouched everywhere.
- **Setlist reader** (`/setlist-charts`, `SetlistChartsPage`):
  - `ReaderBar` with the tune, "Setlist · Tune n of N" and ‹ ›.
  - A **running order** rail on desktop (`RunningOrder`: numbered, each tune's key and tempo for
    the set, played ones dimmed; click to jump; a list button hides it). On phones the list button
    opens it as a bottom sheet.
  - Each chart sits in a `ChartPaper` with its details on top.
  - Along the bottom, a segmented progress bar (click a segment to jump) and "Up next: …".
  - Tunes with no chart get a proper card.
- **Chart page** (`ChartViewPage`):
  - A compact header: round back button, key badge, title and composer, the key select (below
    `xl`), full screen, ⋮.
  - The chart in a `ChartPaper`.
  - From `xl`, a side column with a 12-key grid to transpose (key colours; a dot marks the
    original key; "Back to …"), the chart's playlists (links), and **Your tunes** that use the
    chart (links).
  - Full screen uses `ReaderBar` (minimize button, key select) and a filling `ChartPaper`.
- **Tune page**: the chord chart card is a `ChartPaper` whose top row holds the controls.

Checked signed in to Jack's dev account in nix Chromium: the reader at 1600 wide and 390 wide
(next with the arrow keys, the phone sheet), the chart page, transposing to Fm from the key grid,
full screen, the ⋮ menu, and the tune page. No errors.


### Tunes → Library in the sidebar (2026-10-18, web)

The sidebar's "Tunes" card is now **Library** (new `LibraryIcon`, books on a shelf), since it leads
to tunes, setlists, chord charts and files. Only the name changed: `navLinks.ts`'s `/tunes` entry is
labelled "Library" (its description lists all four, so searching "tunes" still finds it), the
route is still `/tunes`, and the Tunes page keeps its own title and tabs. The card stays lit on
every library page (`isLibraryPath` in `Sidebar.tsx`, which replaced `isChartsPath` and adds
`/files`). Community's "Post a setlist" hint says "make one in your Library first". This was the
first step of a sidebar rethink Jack is considering (group "Your stuff" vs "Tools", one row style,
favorites shown once, the streak shown once, a sign-in card where the account features are).
