### Page transitions with the logo's drum hit (2026-10-10, web)

Every route change (non-tiling mode): the new page slides in from the right (`AppShell`'s
`AnimatedPage`, 480ms ease-out) and the sidebar logo's sticks swing apart and strike back into the
x with the off-beat dashes popping out (`lib/stickStrike.ts`). (A big version of the sticks striking
in the middle of the content area was tried first and removed on request.) `AnimatedLogo` drives the sidebar one. `Logo.tsx`'s sticks are now
grouped (`data-stick="a"|"b"`, `data-ticks`, pivoting on the crossing) so any logo can be struck;
nothing visual changed at rest. Web Animations in a layout effect (no re-renders, no un-animated
frame); skipped on first load and under `prefers-reduced-motion`. The page wrapper is transformed
only while animating, so a page's `position: fixed` elements are offset for that half-second only.
Checked frame by frame in the browser (Metronome to Tuner); in dev a slow first compile shows
`app/loading.tsx` during the slide instead of the page.

### Metronome options redesigned to explain themselves (2026-10-10, web)

`components/metronome/MetronomeOptions.tsx` (Metronome only for now; Polyrhythm and Structure
sections still use `MeterFields.tsx`'s `MeterOptions`/`SoundOptions`). The "Meter & subdivision"
panel is now **Rhythm**: a "One meter / Changing meters" segmented control (was the "Use a
structure" switch; Changing meters shows the unchanged `StructureEditor`), a `TimeSignatureControl`
drawn as a stacked time signature with arrows beside each number and a readout ("7 eighth notes per
bar"), and `SubdivisionPicker` (picture +
short name tiles). Accents are set only by tapping beats in the main beat strip (an "Accents"
group-splitter was tried here and dropped as redundant; the typed grouping field is gone too). **Sound**: click-sound cards that play a preview (accent then normal click) when
picked, and a volume slider with speaker icons that previews on release. No description text;
`CollapsiblePanel` gained `hints={false}` to hide its "?" button where there's nothing to reveal
(Rhythm shows it only in Changing meters mode). Verified in the browser: 4/4 to 7/8 with arrows, triplets, mode switch, sound pick,
light/dark, 390px wide; no errors. Not heard: the sound previews (no audio here).

**Then (same day) the Metronome's options column was replaced by setting chips.** `options={null}`
(`ToolLayout` now hides its "Options" show-button and column when a tool passes no options), and a
row of chips under the beat strip (`components/metronome/SettingsBar.tsx`: `SettingsBar`,
`SettingChip`) shows each setting's current value. Above the chips, a One meter / Changing meters
switch decides which chips there are: one meter shows **Time** ("4/4") and **Subdivision**
("8ths"); changing meters shows the form itself on the page, in a card under the switch (`StructureEditor
show="form"`: the play-order chips, drag to reorder, × to remove, "+ A / + B" to add), and a
**Sections** chip ("3 sections", or "Add sections") whose popover is just the section list with
"New section" (`show="sections" modern`). With `modern`, each section card uses the same controls
as One meter: a name field, `StepperPill` for bars ("‹ 2 › bars"), `TimeSignatureControl`,
`SubdivisionPicker`, the section's beat strip for accents, and Remove; the collapsed card reads
"2 bars of 11/8" next to a badge with the section's name. `StructureEditor` defaults to `show="all"`, so Tempo Trainer and
Recorder are unchanged. **Sound**
("Classic click · 80%") is always there. The chips sit below Start. A chip opens a popover (a bottom sheet with
a dim backdrop on phones; Escape, the ×, or a click outside closes it; one open at a time). The
popover is portaled to `<body>` and `position: fixed`: always just above its chip, kept on screen, and capped to the available height, with
only its body scrolling (header pinned), so a long editor never makes the page scroll (checked: the
page's scroll height is unchanged with a long section list open), holding the same controls
as before (`MetronomeOptions.tsx`). No collapsing, no hiding. The
Rhythm/Sound `CollapsiblePanel`s and `PanelsToggle` are no longer used by the Metronome. Verified in
the browser (each chip's popover, desktop and 390px, Changing meters editing inside the popover); no
errors.

### Every tool's options are setting chips now (2026-10-10, web)

The Metronome's chip pattern, applied site-wide through the shared components rather than tool by
tool. `ToolLayout` renders a tool's `options` as a centred row of chips under the main display
(`OptionChips`: `ChipsModeContext` + `SettingsBar`); the hideable options column and its
"Options" show-button are gone (`sidePanel`s such as History/Struggles/Modulations keep their own
column). Under that context, `CollapsiblePanel` and `OptionSection` render as a `SettingChip`
(`components/SettingsBar.tsx`, moved out of `components/metronome/`) whose popover holds the
panel's children; the popover header carries the panel's "?" descriptions toggle (`HintsButton`)
and, for panels with a `toggle`, a **split chip**: a switch with the label and value that turns the
whole section on/off straight from the chip, plus a separate sliders button that opens the popover;
dimmed while off (value "Off"). The popover then has no switch of its own; opened while off it says
"<Title> is off." with a "Turn on" button. Exception: Note / Scale / Interval Trainer's listen mode is a **Timed | Listen**
selector above the chips (`ToolLayout`'s new `optionsMode` slot, a `Segmented`, disabled while
running), like the Metronome's One meter / Changing meters; with `asMode` the panel (now titled
"Listen") only appears as a plain chip while listening. Tempo Trainer now matches the Metronome exactly: a One meter / Changing
meters selector plus the form card in `optionsMode`, Time + Subdivision chips (one meter) or a
Sections chip (`StructureEditor show="sections" modern`), then Mute cycle ("4 on · 4 off") and
Sound.
`OptionsCard` renders just its sections (sharing one hints setting); `PanelsToggle` renders nothing.
New props on both: `summary` (the chip's value) and `wide`. Summaries added for the obvious ones:
meters ("4/4"), sounds ("Woodblock · 80%", `soundSummary`), pools ("12 of 33"), ranges ("E1-G4"),
Tuner instrument / "A = 440 Hz", Slow Downer speed / markers, count-off/count-in, roll type, Jam
Practice's tune count, Practice Timer sound. Practice Timer has no separate "New session" button: the **New session** chip
(always present) opens the session editor, and a saved session's pencil opens the same popover as
"Edit session" (`SettingChip`/`CollapsiblePanel` gained controlled `open`/`onOpenChange`); closing
the popover keeps an unsaved draft (chip value "Unsaved"), Save/Cancel end it. The Pomodoro editor is `components/PomodoroEditor.tsx`: Work / Break / Long break minute
cards side by side, a Set number / Keep going switch with "Work cycles" and "Long break every N
cycles" steppers, then exactly one optional name field per cycle (per cycle in a round when it keeps
going; `normalizePomodoro` trims `workTitles` to the cycles that exist, so there can't be more names
than cycles), and a preview strip of the run in order with its total time. Work cycles cap at 24. The popover ignores clicks/Escape inside portaled
menus (`[role=listbox|menu]`, e.g. `Select` options), so dropdowns inside popovers work.
`MeterFields`' `MeterOptions` and `SoundOptions` now render the Metronome's controls
(`TimeSignatureControl` + `SubdivisionPicker`; `SoundPicker`), so Polyrhythm, Tempo Trainer, the
Recorder and the classic section cards match; the typed accent-grouping field (`GroupsField`) is
deleted (accents come from tapping each tool's beat strip). Verified: every tool page in the
browser at 1440 and 390 wide (chips, a popover each, no errors), `tsc`, `eslint`, `next build`.
The Recorder's metronome got the same treatment, but its chips live inside the Metronome card
(shown while the metronome is on) rather than under the page, since the recordings list sits below
it: One meter / Changing meters, the form card, Time / Subdivision or Sections, Count-in, Sound
(`SettingsBar fit` wraps within the card). Checked in the browser by temporarily bypassing the
signed-in gate (reverted). The Recorder page is now `layout="stacked"` (vertically centred) with a grid: on desktop
the Metronome card on the left and the recorder (timer, record button, auto gain) above recent
recordings on the right; on phones recorder, then metronome, then recordings.
