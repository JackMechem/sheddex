# How sheddex fits together

A short tour of the code for anyone reading the repo. For the rules and full history, see
[docs/README.md](README.md).

## The pieces

```
apps/web          The website (Next.js App Router + Tailwind v4). The main product.
apps/mobile       The iOS/Android app (Expo SDK 57, Expo Router, NativeWind for layout).
packages/core     Shared pure TypeScript: music theory, parsers, generators, practice-log logic.
packages/convex   The backend (Convex): schema, queries, mutations, actions, auth.
```

It's a pnpm workspace. Web and mobile both import `@jam-practice/core` and talk to the same
Convex deployment through `@jam-practice/convex`.

## Data: local first, account optional

Every tool works without an account.

- **Signed out:** settings and data stay on the device — localStorage (`usePersistedSettings`) and
  IndexedDB on web (audio files for the Slow Downer), AsyncStorage on mobile.
- **Signed in:** the same hooks read and write the account instead. Most tools store one JSON
  value per settings key in the generic `syncedSettings` table (`useSyncedSettings`), with a
  debounced, race-safe cache in `apps/web/lib/syncedStore.ts`. There's no merge between device and
  account data: signing in just switches which store is used. Mobile also keeps an AsyncStorage
  copy so it works offline.
- **Things with their own tables:** the chord-chart library (one row per song, bars separate),
  Community posts, profiles and follows, recordings and tune songs (Convex file storage), setlists
  shared by link, routines, Lessons (students, lessons, items, hand-ins, bookings), Bass Genius
  players and transcriptions, feedback, admin roles, site flags, usage counts.

## Audio

All sound is made on the device.

- **Web:** Web Audio. Clicks are synthesized and scheduled ahead on the audio clock
  (`lib/clickEngine.ts`); instruments use real samples (piano, Rhodes, upright bass, drums) loaded
  on demand and pitch-shifted to the nearest note (`lib/sampledTones.ts`, `lib/uprightBass.ts`,
  `lib/drumSounds.ts`). Pitch detection for the listening tools is in `packages/core/pitchDetect.ts`.
- **Mobile:** `react-native-audio-api` (Web-Audio-like) for samples and the tuner, `expo-audio`
  for playback and recording, pre-rendered click WAVs for the metronome.

## Backend

Convex functions live at the root of `packages/convex` (`convex.json` sets that). Auth is Convex
Auth: email + password with emailed codes (Resend) and Google. Each function checks who's calling;
anything read across users re-checks privacy on the server. Deleting an account cascades through
every table in `account.ts`.

## Deploying

Vercel builds `apps/web` and, in the same build, deploys Convex to production. See
[guides/deploying.md](guides/deploying.md).
