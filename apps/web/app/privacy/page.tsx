        sheddex (<LegalLink href="https://sheddex.com">sheddex.com</LegalLink>) is a free, non-commercial set of music practice tools run by Jack
        Mechem. This page says what it collects and why, in plain words.
      </p>

      <LegalSection title="The short version">
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>Every tool works without an account. Signed out, your stuff stays in your browser.</li>
          <li>With an account, your stuff is saved to sheddex&apos;s servers so it follows you between devices.</li>
          <li>Only what you choose to make public (a public profile, a post, a shared link) is seen by anyone else.</li>
          <li>sheddex counts which pages and tools get used, anonymously. No ads, no third-party trackers, nothing sold.</li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="Signed out">
        <p>
          Your settings, tunes, chord charts, practice history and any audio files you open stay in your browser&apos;s own storage. They aren&apos;t
          sent to sheddex. Clearing your browser&apos;s data for sheddex.com deletes them.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="With an account">
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>
            <strong>Sign-in:</strong> your email address and password (stored hashed, so nobody can read it), or, with Google, your email and name.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Your stuff:</strong> tool settings, tune lists, chord charts, setlists, your Shed Log, recordings and any files you upload (PDFs,
            images, audio, video and so on, on their own or attached to a tune). Each account can store up to 1 GB.
            When you sign in, sheddex uses what&apos;s saved to the account; it doesn&apos;t merge in what was saved in that browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Profile:</strong> your username, and if you add them, a picture, banner and instruments.
          </li>
          <li>Emailed confirmation codes are stored hashed and expire after 15 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Slow Downer&apos;s audio files always stay in your browser, signed in or not.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="What others can see">
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>
            <strong>Public profile</strong> (off until you turn it on): your username, picture, instruments, all your Tunes I Know and Tunes to Learn
            (names, keys, tempos; never your notes), ear-training levels and stars, who you follow and who follows you, and unless you turn it off, a
            Shed Log summary (streaks, hours, days practiced, milestones; never your routines, tasks or notes). Anyone can view it, with or without an
            account. Make it private again at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Posts and shared links:</strong> anything you post to Community, and any setlist, routine or tune you share by link, can be seen by
            whoever has it. Recordings attached to a shared setlist can be played by them too. A shared tune shows its keys, tempos, chord chart, the
            files attached to it and its recordings (never its notes), and whoever has the link can download those files and save a copy. Stop sharing
            at any time and the link stops working.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lessons:</strong> once you join a teacher, they see a summary of your Shed Log, how you&apos;re doing on the routines they gave you
            (including notes and recordings on those), and anything you hand in. Not your other routines, notes or recordings. Lesson materials, hand-ins
            and booking details are shared only between the teacher and that student, and booking emails go to both. Leave a teacher at any time.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="Usage counts">
        <p>
          To see what&apos;s useful, sheddex counts, per day: visits, page views, which tools are started and how long they run, and whether a visit
          was signed in. Only daily totals are kept (for example, &quot;the Metronome was started 40 times on Tuesday&quot;). They aren&apos;t tied to
          you, your account or your device, and no IP address or advertising ID is stored. Nothing is counted if your browser sends Do Not Track or
          Global Privacy Control. Account activity sheddex already has (like when an account was created) is also summed into charts for the
          administrator.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="Feedback and reports">
        <p>
          When you send feedback or report a post or profile, sheddex keeps your message, the page you were on, your browser and device type, any
          screenshot you attach, and your account (or the email you typed if you&apos;re signed out), so it can be fixed and answered.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="Administration">
        <p>
          The administrators can see each account&apos;s email, username, sign-in method and sign-up date, read feedback, and remove posts or accounts
          that break the <LegalLink href="/terms">terms</LegalLink>. They don&apos;t browse your private stuff (your library, Shed Log, recordings or
          notes).
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="Cookies and browser storage">
        <p>Only what the site needs to work: keeping you signed in, your theme, tool settings and similar preferences. No ad or tracking cookies.</p>

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="Keeping and deleting">
        <p>
          Your data is kept while your account exists. Deleting your account (from the Account page) permanently removes it and everything tied to it:
          profile, posts, library, Shed Log, recordings, files, lessons and feedback. Daily usage totals aren&apos;t tied to anyone, so there&apos;s
          nothing of yours in them to delete.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="Security">
        <p>Passwords are stored hashed and traffic is encrypted (HTTPS). Nothing online is perfectly secure, so sheddex keeps only what it needs.</p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="Children">
        <p>sheddex isn&apos;t aimed at children under 13. If you think a child has made an account, get in touch and it will be removed.</p>
      </LegalSection>
