            connection) — the app's first-ever context providers. Purely additive: no visual/DOM
            change, everything below is unchanged.

            Tried dropping ConvexAuthNextjsServerProvider to keep every route statically
            prerendered (it forces dynamic rendering app-wide by reading cookies() in the root
            layout — confirmed via `pnpm build`'s route summary going from every route ○ Static to
            every route ƒ Dynamic). That's not just a missed optimization: without it, `pnpm build`
            fails outright — "Cannot destructure property 'isLoading' of 'c(...)' as it is
            undefined" while prerendering /chord-charts — Convex Auth's client-side context isn't
            safely renderable during Next's build-time static pass on its own. So this is the
            required setup, not a preference; every route being server-rendered-on-demand is the
            real, unavoidable cost of adding Convex Auth here. */}
