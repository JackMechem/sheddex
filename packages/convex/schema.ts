      round-trips its own settings object through `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse` for
      `usePersistedSettings` (`lib/usePersistedSettings.ts`), so it's already guaranteed

      (`lib/profileTunes.ts` — name/tempos/keys/time signature, never `notes`) taken from the
      poster's own Tunes list at post time, not a live reference to it, stored as `v.any()` since
      `PublicTune[]` is already a stable, hand-typed shape and storing it as an opaque blob means a
      future field added to it doesn't also need a schema migration here.
      **A chord chart can only ever be posted by being attached to a tune** — each `PublicTune` in
      `tunes` may carry its own `linkedChart` (a fully-resolved snapshot, set at post time by
      `convex/communityTunes.ts`'s `create` via `resolveLinkedChart`, from that tune's own
      `chordChartId` — see `Tune`'s own doc comment in `@jam-practice/core/types` for how a tune
      gets linked to a chart in the first place). There used to be a second, separate post type
      (`communityChordCharts`/`communityChordChartSongs`, a chart or chart-playlist with no tune
      attached) — removed outright per an explicit request to stop the two post types from being
      "quite confusing": now there's exactly one thing to post, and a chart is just something a
      tune can optionally carry along with it. Searching for a chart specifically is still
      possible — see `convex/communityTunes.ts`'s `chartTitlesOf`/the `chartCount` field each
      summary carries, which is what a "chord charts" search scope filters on.
      Posting requires the caller's own profile to be `isPublic`; browsing just needs to be signed
      in, and a post is dropped from every read once its author's profile isn't (or is no longer)
      public, same privacy rule as everywhere else in this app.
      `likeCount` is denormalized here (kept in sync by `communityTunes.ts`'s `toggleLike`, inside
      the same mutation that writes `communityTuneLikes` below) specifically so showing a list of
      posts never has to separately count each one's own likes — the same "don't make reading a
      list cost more as more side-data piles up" reasoning `chordChartSongs`'s own metadata/`bars`
      split already follows elsewhere in this file. `optional` since every post created before
      liking existed doesn't have it — every reader treats a missing one as `0` (`row.likeCount ??
      0`), not a migration.
      `unlisted` (default `false`, same "missing means false" treatment as `likeCount`'s missing-
      means-zero) opts a post out of `list`/`listByUser` — the two *browsable* surfaces — without
      touching anything else: `get` (a direct link to the post, what "Share" copies) and `mine`
      (the poster's own post-management list) both work exactly the same regardless. The point
      isn't privacy from Convex's own access-control perspective (any signed-in account that
      already has `get`'s id can still open it, same as a listed post) — it's "don't show up where
      people browse," so a poster can share a link to something without it also becoming
      discoverable to everyone else. */

  /** A signed-in user's personal Chord Charts library — replaces an earlier version of this
      feature that stored the *whole* library (every song's full parsed bar list) as one
      `syncedSettings` blob. That broke for real: importing a large iReal Pro playlist produced a
      single JSON document over Convex's 1 MiB per-document limit, and the write was rejected
      outright (`Value is too large (4.62 MiB > maximum size 1 MiB)`). Split across three tables
      instead, specifically so no single document's size grows with the size of the library:
      - `chordChartPlaylists` — just a name. Charts live once in the library ("All charts") and a
        playlist only *references* them, so one chart can be in several playlists. A chart's
        memberships are its own `playlistId` (optional — the first playlist it landed in, kept on
        the row so the common one-playlist case costs no extra reads and older data needs no
        migration) plus any `chordChartPlaylistEntries` rows. No `songIds` array on the playlist
        row, which would grow unboundedly for a big playlist.
      - `chordChartSongs` — one row per song, metadata only (title/composer/style/key/time
        signature) — deliberately *not* `bars`, so listing or deduping a library never has to
        touch each song's own (often much larger) notation.
      - `chordChartSongBars` — a song's parsed bar list, split into its own table so a single
        tune's notation is the only thing that ever has to fit under the 1 MiB limit, never the
        whole library or even a whole playlist. Fetched only for whichever one song is actually
        displayed (`convex/chordCharts.ts`'s `getSongBars`) — never all at once as part of listing
        the library. A chart posted to Community travels as part of its tune's own `linkedChart`
        snapshot (see `communityTunes`'s own comment) — `convex/lib/chordCharts.ts`'s
        `resolveLinkedChart` reads straight from this table server-side, never through the client.
      Signed out, this tool is entirely unaffected and keeps using the original single-blob
      `syncedSettings` approach via `lib/chordChartsLibrary.ts` — localStorage doesn't enforce
      anything like Convex's 1 MiB-per-document limit, so there's no equivalent failure mode to
      fix there. `convex/chordCharts.ts`'s `migrateFromSyncedSettings` is a one-time, entirely
      server-side migration for anyone who already had a (successfully-synced, and therefore
      already-under-1-MiB) library stored the old way before this change. */
